UNION_BASED_SQL_INJECTION_PAYLOAD_LEVEL_1=<code>UNION</code> operator in SQL is used to combine the resultset of two or more select queries. A similar approach is used by hackers to retrieve the entire data from the database which includes credit card details, personally identifiable information, etc. of other users using the application.

If you insert the following statement in the textbox, you will get information about a user from the table.
UNION_BASED_SQL_INJECTION_PAYLOAD_LEVEL_2=<code>UNION</code> operator in SQL is used to combine the resultset of two or more select queries. A similar approach is used by hackers to retrieve the entire data from the database which includes credit card details, personally identifiable information, etc. of other users using the application. Following input <code>5 UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1</code> does not work here because additional security was added by surrounding value of <code>id</code> parameter with quotes e.g.  <code>id='value'</code><br/>\
  So now we have to insert the following statement in the textbox:<br/>\
<code>5' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE id='1</code><br/>\
If you insert the following statement in the textbox, you will get information about a user from the table.
