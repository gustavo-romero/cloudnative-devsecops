		Note: 
		1. Please clear the cookies from browser.<br/>
		2. This level is same as its previous level, just the difference is JWT is passed in Authorization Header. <br/>
		The reason for adding this level is that scanner generally don't inject payloads in Authorization header as <br/>
		it can break scan rule but for JWT, this is an important header and should be injected and operated upon. <br/>
